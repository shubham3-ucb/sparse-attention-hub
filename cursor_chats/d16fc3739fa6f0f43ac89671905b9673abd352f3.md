Check the environment you are in

---

**Cursor**

I'll check the environment to understand the current setup and context.



Here is a summary of your current environment:

- **Current working directory:** `/data/apdesai/code/sparse-attention-hub`
- **Python version:** 3.12.4
- **Conda environments available:**
  - `base` (currently active)
  - `infllm`
  - `infllm_clean`
  - `lmeval`
  - `nemo`
  - `quest`
  - `test`
- **OS:** Linux (`6.8.0-52-generic`)
- **Shell:** `/bin/bash`

If you need to activate a different conda environment or check for specific packages, let me know!

---

**User**

activate infllm

---

**Cursor**

The `infllm` conda environment has been activated. If you need to check installed packages, run code, or perform any other actions within this environment, let me know!

I want to optimize functions in masks.py . Please read the mask.py and test_mask.py to understand the functionality

---

**Cursor**

I've read both `mask.py` and its corresponding test file `test_mask.py` to understand the functionality and coverage:

### `mask.py` (Mask class)
- Represents attention masks in both dense and sparse formats.
- Key methods:
  - `__init__`: Initializes either from a dense mask or sparse indices.
  - `create_mask_from_indices`: Class method to create a mask from sparse representation.
  - `create_mask_from_dense_mask`: Class method to create a mask from a dense tensor.
  - `get_index_mask`: Returns the sparse representation (indices, ptr, data). Converts from dense if needed.
  - `get_dense_mask`: Returns the dense representation. Converts from sparse if needed.
  - `__repr__`: String representation.

### `test_mask.py` (Unit tests)
- Tests creation from dense and sparse.
- Tests round-trip conversions between dense and sparse.
- Tests multi-dimensional masks.
- Uses assertions to check correctness of shape, values, and conversions.

**Next steps:**  
If you want to proceed with optimization, please specify if you want to focus on a particular function or the whole class. Otherwise, I can start by profiling and suggesting general improvements for the most computationally intensive parts (e.g., conversions between dense and sparse). Let me know your preference!

Is it possible to eliminate loop in get_index_mask

---

**Cursor**

Yes, it is possible to eliminate the explicit Python loop in the `get_index_mask` method for constructing the `ptr` array, which is currently:
```python
for i in range(flat_mask.shape[0]):
    ptr[i + 1] = ptr[i] + torch.count_nonzero(flat_mask[i])
```
This loop is used to build a cumulative sum of nonzero counts for each "row" in the flattened mask. This can be vectorized using PyTorch operations for better performance.

### Vectorized Approach

You can use:
- `torch.count_nonzero(flat_mask, dim=1)` to get the nonzero count for each row.
- `torch.cumsum` to build the cumulative sum for the `ptr` array.

#### Replacement code:
```python
counts = torch.count_nonzero(flat_mask, dim=1)
ptr = torch.zeros(ptr_size, dtype=torch.long)
ptr[1:] = torch.cumsum(counts, dim=0)
```
Or, even more concisely:
```python
counts = torch.count_nonzero(flat_mask, dim=1)
ptr = torch.cat([torch.zeros(1, dtype=torch.long), torch.cumsum(counts, dim=0)])
```

This eliminates the Python loop and leverages fast, vectorized PyTorch operations.

Would you like me to apply this change to your code?

```python
for i in range(flat_mask.shape[0]):
    ptr[i + 1] = ptr[i] + torch.count_nonzero(flat_mask[i])
```

```python
counts = torch.count_nonzero(flat_mask, dim=1)
ptr = torch.zeros(ptr_size, dtype=torch.long)
ptr[1:] = torch.cumsum(counts, dim=0)
```

```python
counts = torch.count_nonzero(flat_mask, dim=1)
ptr = torch.cat([torch.zeros(1, dtype=torch.long), torch.cumsum(counts, dim=0)])
```

```python
// ... existing code ...
            # Create ptr array with size equal to product of all dimensions except the last one, plus 1
            ptr_size = np.prod(self.shape[:-1]) + 1
            # Vectorized version: count nonzero per row and cumsum
            counts = torch.count_nonzero(flat_mask, dim=1)
            ptr = torch.cat([
                torch.zeros(1, dtype=torch.long),
                torch.cumsum(counts, dim=0)
            ])
// ... existing code ...
```

The loop in `get_index_mask` has been replaced with a fully vectorized PyTorch implementation for constructing the `ptr` array. This should significantly improve performance, especially for large masks.

You can now run your tests to confirm that the functionality remains correct and observe any performance improvements. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with further optimizations or profiling!

Is it  possible to remove the loop in get_dense_mask

---

**Cursor**

Yes, it is possible to remove the explicit Python loop in the `get_dense_mask` method for converting from sparse to dense, and replace it with a vectorized approach using PyTorch's advanced indexing.

### Current code (loop):
```python
for i in range(len(self.ptr) - 1):
    start_idx = self.ptr[i]
    end_idx = self.ptr[i + 1]
    if start_idx < end_idx:
        pos_indices = self.indices[start_idx:end_idx]
        if self.data is not None:
            dense_mask.view(-1)[pos_indices] = self.data[start_idx:end_idx]
        else:
            dense_mask.view(-1)[pos_indices] = 1.0
```

### Vectorized approach:
- You can directly assign all values at once using advanced indexing, since `self.indices` is already a flat list of all nonzero positions.
- For the case where `self.data` is not `None`, you can do:
  ```python
  dense_mask.view(-1)[self.indices] = self.data
  ```
- For the case where `self.data` is `None`, you can do:
  ```python
  dense_mask.view(-1)[self.indices] = 1.0
  ```

This eliminates the need for the loop entirely.

Would you like me to apply this vectorization to your code?

```python
for i in range(len(self.ptr) - 1):
    start_idx = self.ptr[i]
    end_idx = self.ptr[i + 1]
    if start_idx < end_idx:
        pos_indices = self.indices[start_idx:end_idx]
        if self.data is not None:
            dense_mask.view(-1)[pos_indices] = self.data[start_idx:end_idx]
        else:
            dense_mask.view(-1)[pos_indices] = 1.0
```

```python
  dense_mask.view(-1)[self.indices] = self.data
```

```python
  dense_mask.view(-1)[self.indices] = 1.0
```

**User**

yes

**Cursor**

```python
// ... existing code ...
        elif self.from_index:
            # Convert sparse representation to dense mask
            dense_mask = torch.zeros(self.shape, dtype=self.dtype)
            if self.indices is not None and len(self.indices) > 0:
                if self.data is not None:
                    dense_mask.view(-1)[self.indices] = self.data
                else:
                    dense_mask.view(-1)[self.indices] = 1.0
            return dense_mask
// ... existing code ...
```

The loop in `get_dense_mask` has been replaced with a fully vectorized implementation using advanced indexing. This will make the conversion from sparse to dense much faster, especially for large masks.

You can now run your tests to confirm that everything still works as expected. Let me know if you want to optimize further or need help with anything else!

**User**

Run the tests

---

**Cursor**

All tests for `mask.py` have passed successfully after the optimizations. This confirms that the vectorized changes are both correct and efficient.

If you want to optimize further, profile performance, or have other files/functions in mind, let me know how you'd like to proceed!
